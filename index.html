    <br> Hi,

    <br> I am thinking about conducting a 6 week pilot program making use of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>
    <br> During these 6 weeks, participants will get together for 3 times per week and assist each other. We will not have an instructor and so we will be relying solely on the content that is available via Khan Academy.
    <br> The primary goal is foster a culture whereby 1) The participants can take the agency over their own learning and b) Start developing confidence, that will hopefully lead them towards mastery in this subject.
    <br> As a participant, you can start at any level (starting with Early Math / K-2nd grade) and proceed at a pace that you are comfortable with. To get value out of this pilot project, it would be ideal if participants spend at least 30 to 45 minutes (5 times a week) practicing skill development via Khan Academy.
    <br> Here are the details:
    <br>
   
    <li>Duration: 6 weeks</li>
    <br>
    <li>Total number of participants for this pilot project: 15.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Frequency: 3 times per week for 45 minutes each session.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Mode: Khan Academyâ€™s coaching features are used to track student progress (So, once you have created your account, then please feel free to share your username with me. I'll be hosting these sessions). But we will keep this as optional.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Awards will be provided for participation, effort, and badges earned. Although I am not sure how these awards will be delivered to global participants.</li>
    <br>

    <li>At the end of the 6-week session, a party is going to be held to celebrate (Somewhere along the Greater Toronto region).</li>
    <br>

    <li>Requires: For you to have a computer that functions and an internet connection.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Cost: Absolutely free. (Khan Academy is also free to use)</li>
    <br>

    <li>Sessions are going to be scheduled during the evenings (Eastern Time)</li>
    <br>

    <li>We will leverage principles via a) Carol Dweck's book, Mindset (The psychology of success) link and b) Deep Work via Cal Newport link</li>
    <br>

    <li>Note: There is no age-limit. But if you are not an adult, then an email (approval) from your parents is going to be required.</li>
    <br> If interested, then please sign-up using the google sheet (link towards the beginning)
    <br> Thanks!
